# Robot Arm

A simple 3d wireframe robotic arm whose movement is controlled by the user. The robot arm is also programmable, allowing the user to define a sequence of movements and replay them.

This ended up qualifying as my high school senior project after I decided to add the ability to save programmed sequences to files so they could be loaded on a later run of the program and gave the robot the ability to pick up boxes. I was going to work on being able to stack boxes too, but never got that far. Maybe in a later update...

The project files are named Robot3 because my version of source control back then was to copy the folder and increment the number in the filenames hahaha! And even then, it was only for major revisions where I knew I would probably break something.
