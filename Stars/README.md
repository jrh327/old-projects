# Stars

All it does is draw a four-pointed star in different colors. I used to think it looked cool. I still do, but I used to, too.

The files I found were last touched on February 10, 2010, but there was also a .exe from September 26, 2009. Not really sure why I went from the original version that displayed random colors or cycled through red, green, and blue, but the most recent version just goes from black to white, getting lighter with every line, and then clears the screen. I will be re-implementing the others later.
