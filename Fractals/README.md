Draws a few simple fractal shapes, in particular the Sierpinski Triangle, Koch Snowflake, and binary fractal tree.

This project started as a way to teach the class about recursion. It was honestly one of the hardest projects we had. But it taught me a lot, and ignited a passion for fractals that I've had ever since.
