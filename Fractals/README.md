# Fractals

Draws a few simple fractal shapes, in particular the Sierpinski Triangle, Koch Snowflake, and binary fractal tree.

This project started as a way to teach the class about recursion. It was honestly one of the hardest projects we had. But it taught me a lot, and ignited a passion for fractals that I've had ever since. The hardest one was the Koch snowflake, which I never finished. I've implemented it a few times throughout the years by looking it up, but that's no fun, so I finally did it without cheating while porting this project to Java.

The Fractal Flower is not part of the original assignment in high school. It is instead a small app I worked on after realizing that the Fractal Tree can look like a flower, which can be seen by running Fractal Tree with Randomness checked. I made it for my girlfriend, thinking she might like it (I was not wrong). I could have sworn there was a VB6 version, but I can't currently locate it. I actually recently recreated it for her, outside of this project, and the included version is the result of that.
