Just a collection of some old projects from high school and freshman year of college. Mostly just posting for historical purposes, and for the fun of revisiting and reviving old projects.

Most of these were originally written in Visual Basic 6, because that is what my high school Computer Science class had available. The original code from these projects will be included exactly as I find it on my old flash drives. Most of them will then be ported to Java, and probably also JavaScript. I don't expect to ever update the VB6 code, unless I get ahold of a compiler for it.
