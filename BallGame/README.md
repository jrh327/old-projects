# Ball Game

Another slightly more recent project. This is actually the first game I ever wrote in Java. I wrote this during my first job, during the summer of 2011. I was told to learn Java, just in case I was needed to help on stuff later. I figured, what better way to learn a new language than to write a game in it? It's obviously not the most perfectly written game ever, but I don't think it looks too bad for having learned the language as I worked on it.
